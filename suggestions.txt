##alternative definition of security goal
	  -machine learning in adversarial situations
	  -right now: improve detection of vandal edits (compared to ClueBotNG)
	  -other ways we define a win?
##reduce amount of vandalism:
	-eg rate limit
	-enforce subscription
	-geographic information. 
	-detection (our focus so far)
##vandalism detection (improve classifier performance):
	 -add features
	 -run 

##specific ideas for features:
-feature idea: series of  edit times for a user
-feature idea: feedback (reviewers, votes)
-hopefully these 4 features give new things
-how many edits come from first time users (and how much of it is vandalism)
-ip addresses

##deadlines:

##goals:
	-3 days (by sunday 29th) should have enough *good* features, ie good correlation > 0.2
	-3 days (by Wednesday 2nd) should have cluebot ng running with new features
	-4 days later (by sundahy 6th) try to get the performance higher (eg 5%)
	-security defn. in slides.
	-presentation may 9th (no geza then) or 14th
	-report may 16thki
